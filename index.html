        <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px;margin-left: 20px;">The learning rate factor, or α(t), refers to how much a node learns from each data
vector and should start out as fairly large in the first phase, but should be very low in
the final phase. A commonly used starting point is 0.5 for the first phase, and 0.05 in the final phase.<br>
                              The selection of the network neighborhood size, Nc(t), is possibly the most
important parameter. If the selected neighborhood size is too small, the network will not
be ordered globally. This will result in various mosaic-like patterns, with unordered data
in between. Therefore, the initial network radius should be rather large, preferably larger
than half the network diameter (Kohonen, 1997). Generally, the final network radius
             should be about 10% of the radius used in the first part.</p>
        <p style="<b>;font-size: 30px;margin-left: 20px;">Financial Ratios</p>
          <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px;margin-left: 20px;">The performance of the companies included was rated according to seven different
financial ratios. These were chosen based on an empirical study by Lehtinen (1996).
Lehtinen rated different ratios according to two factors: their reliability in the international context, and the validity of the ratio. The reliability of a ratio implies how much the
ratio is affected by international accounting differences, while validity measures how
well the ratio measures the intended principle (Lehtinen, 1996). Since the comparison in
this experiment is an international one, high reliability has been prioritized.<br>
                         Financial ratios can be divided into four classes: profitability ratios, liquidity ratios,
solvency ratios, and efficiency ratios (Lehtinen, 1996). The emphasis in this experiment
has been on profitability, since this can be considered the most commonly used measure
            of a company’s success. The chosen ratios are displayed below:</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;font-size: 30px;margin-left: 30px;">Profitability</p>
        <img src="equation%201.jpg">
        <p style="font-style: italic;font-size: 30px;margin-left: 30px;">Liquidity</p>
        <img src="equation%202.jpg">
        <p style="font-style: italic;font-size: 30px;margin-left: 30px;">Solvency</p>
        <img src="equation%203.jpg">
        <p style="font-style: italic;font-size: 30px;margin-left: 30px;">Efficiency</p>
        <img src="equation%204.jpg"> <br>
         <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px;margin-left: 20px;">Profitability naturally measures how well a company is able to generate profit on the
invested capital. Operating Margin was chosen as the first ratio for three reasons. First,
it is a very commonly used ratio, and second, it is very simple and quick to calculate.
Finally, and most importantly, it is a rather reliable measure in an international context.
This is because it uses total income instead of net income, thus ignoring posts like
extraordinary income/expenses, depreciation in excess of plan, and taxation. There is,
however, a problem with Operating Margin. Since Operating Margin is an income
statement ratio, implying that figures are only taken from the income statement, the ratio
             does not take capital into account. This makes the ratio less valid (Lehtinen, 1996).<br>
                        In order to remedy this, Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Total Assets (ROTA)
were also included as profitability ratios. These ratios are called mixed ratios, since they
take into account both the income statement and the balance sheet, thus providing us
with ratios that take into account both profit and capital. This makes them very valid ratios
for measuring profit. Of the two ratios, ROE is more sensitive to international accounting
differences, thus making it slightly less reliable than Operating Margin or ROTA. This
is because ROE uses net income, which is more heavily influenced by accounting
differences than total income. Also, the denominator of ROE includes retained earnings,
which contain differences retained from previous years. However, because of its very
high validity, ROE was included in the experiment. ROTA, on the other hand, is both very
             valid and very reliable in an international context (Lehtinen, 1996).<br>
                  Liquidity ratios measure the ability of a company to meet its short-term financial
obligations, i.e., how much liquid assets (cash, sales receivables, inventories, etc.) a
company has. Quick Ratio, like Operating Margin, was chosen because it is commonly
used, is easy to calculate, and is very reliable. Quick ratio, unlike Current Ratio, does not
include the value of inventories, since these are in many ways not as liquid as receivables
or cash. However, Quick Ratio is less valid than ratios that include figures from both the
income statement and balance sheet. However, such ratios are very complicated to
calculate and are not as reliable as Quick Ratio and Current Ratio (Lehtinen, 1996).</p>
         <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px;margin-left: 20px;">Solvency ratios measure how indebted a company is, or how well a company is able
to meet its long-term financial obligations. Equity to Capital is included because it is one
of the most commonly used ratios in financial comparisons. However, it does suffer from
much of the same problems as ROE and is not therefore as reliable as some other ratios.
Therefore, Interest Coverage was included as a second solvency ratio, since it is much
more reliable than Equity to Capital (Lehtinen, 1996).<br>
Efficiency, as the name indicates, measures how efficiently a company uses its
resources. In this experiment, Receivables Turnover was chosen since it is both valid and
             reliable (Lehtinen, 1996)</p>

         <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px;margin-left: 20px;">Each year, in its September issue, Pulp and Paper International ranks the top 150
pulp and paper-producing companies in the world, according to net sales. The list for 1998
(Matussek, Janssens, Kenny, & Riannon, 1999) was used as the basis when choosing
the companies in Eklund et al. (2001). Since then, an updated list has been reviewed
(Rhiannon, Jewitt, Galasso, & Fortemps, 2001), and the changes were incorporated in the
experiment. This experiment was limited to using data available through the companies’
annual reports for the years 1995-2000. The primary source for these annual reports was
the individual companies’ homepages on the Internet, but any physical reports available
were also used.<br>
                                     The principle problem in the choice of companies was getting annual reports for all
five years. As it turns out, many companies did not provide enough information on their
homepages, and we were forced to leave out many companies that were highly ranked
on the Top 150 list. This problem was most common among European (excluding
Scandinavian companies) and Asian countries, although some U.S. and Canadian
companies also caused difficulties. However, through large online databases, we were
able to obtain adequate financial information for most U.S., Canadian, and Japanese
companies. Generally, the companies that provided the most financial information on
their pages were Finnish or Swedish. The final selection of companies is illustrated in
Table 1.<br>
                                   Some companies could not be included for other reasons. For example, on the list for 2000, Proctor & Gamble (P&G) was listed as the third largest producer in the world.
However, as only 30% of P&G’s turnover comes from pulp and paper, we decided not to include it. Also, number six on the list, Nippon Unipac holding, was formed by the merger of Nippon Paper Industries and Daishowa Paper in March 2001, and was, therefore, still included as two separate companies. Also, two companies (Stora Enso and UPMKymmene), were included as single companies, even though they emerged through the mergers of companies during the course of the experiment. However, using consolidated reports published by the companies after the merger, we included them as single companies, in order to simplify analysis.</p>

        </center>
        <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px;margin-left: 20px;">In order to improve the training process of the neural network, input data must often
be preprocessed. In this case, we refer to preprocessing as the process of standardizing
the data according to some method, although the term also includes the “cleaning” of
data, i.e., the removal of errors, missing values, and inconsistencies. If data is not
preprocessed, the neural network might expend its learning time on variables with large
            variances or values, and therefore ignore variables with smaller variances or values.</p>
        <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px;margin-left: 20px;">Preprocessing of data is a much-discussed method in literature concerning neural
networks. Sarle (2001) suggests that the most suitable form of normalization centers the
input values around zero, instead of, for example, within the interval [0,1]. This would
imply the use of, for example, normalization by standard deviation. Kohonen (1997)
suggests two methods for standardizing the data: normalization by standard deviation
and heuristically justifiable rescaling. Another method, suggested by Klimasauskas
(1991), and used, for example, by Back et al. (1998, 2000), is histogram equalization.
Histogram equalization is a way of mapping rare events to a small part of the data range,
and spreading out frequent events. This way the network is better able to discriminate
between rare and frequent events.
Normally, the values should be scaled according to their relative importance.
However, according to Kaski and Kohonen (1996), this is not necessary when no
differences in importance can be assumed. As this is also the case in this experiment, we
have not used any form of scaling according to importance. Instead, the relative
importance of the different categories of ratios has been set through the balance of ratios
(three in profitability, two in solvency, one in liquidity, and one in efficiency).
In this experiment, the data has been standardized according to the variance of the
            entire dataset (Equations 5 and 6), also the method used by Kaski and Kohonen (1996).</p>
        <img src="equation%205.jpg">
        <p style="<b>;font-size: 20px;margin-left: 20px;">where M = number of ratios, N = number of observations, x = value of ratio, and x = the
average of the financial ratios.
Normalizing the data according to the standard deviation was tried, but the maps
obtained using this method were unsatisfactory for clustering purposes. Also, in order
to achieve feasible results, a preliminary rescaling had to be done. This implied replacing
extreme values with 50 (positive or negative). The reason for this is that a number of the
ratios reached incredibly high values, which caused the SOM to illustrate one area with
extreme values on the map, with the rest of the map being flat and uninterpretable.
Therefore, such extreme values were replaced in this experiment.
The SOM_PAK 3.1 program package was used to train the maps in this experiment.
SOM_PAK is a program package created by a team of researchers at the Neural Networks
Research Centre (NNRC) at the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT). SOM_PAK
can be downloaded from http://www.cis.hut.fi/research/som_pak/, and may be freely
used for scientific purposes. Readers are referred to the program package for sample data.
The maps were visualized using Nenet 1.1, another downloadable program. A limited
demo version of Nenet is available at http://koti.mbnet.fi/~phodju/nenet/Nenet/
Download.html. Nenet is actually a complete SOM training program, but the demo
            version is severely limited, and has been used for visualization, since the maps are</p>
